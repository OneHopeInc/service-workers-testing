    <h1>LESSON 3</h1>
    <h2>“The Biggest Mistake of My Life”</h2>
    
    <h3>TEACHER PREPARATION</h3>
    
    <h4>Lesson Summary</h4>
    <p>
    Research shows that teens spend hours on social media and online, and are turning to social media to find affirmation and a sense of identity. 
    Instead, they experience comparison, restlessness, and even addiction. 
    Only God can give your teens satisfaction, joy, and rest. In today’s lesson, we will discuss a scenario that contains sensitive content. 
    <mark>We want to encourage teens to interact with social media in healthy ways and help them overcome their addictions.</mark>
    </p>
    
    <h4>Scripture References</h4>
    <blockquote>
    Romans 7:18–19, 21–25; Galatians 2:20; 1 Corinthians 10:13; Psalm 34:18
    </blockquote>
    
    <h4>Lesson Goals</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Teens will discover that a relationship with God will help them fight the battle with sin within them.</li>
      <li>Teens will explore healthy ways of interacting with social media.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Materials</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Paper</li>
      <li>Pencil or Pen</li>
      <li><b>Book of Hope: A Better Way to Life</b> – <i>Article:</i> “The Biggest Mistake of My Life” – pages 8–9</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Additional Information</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>African teens are spending more time online than the global average. These online communities provide quantity, but not necessarily quality, of connection. Online relationships are often filtered and can’t replace real-world connection.</li>
      <li>Today’s article includes a reference to nudity. Use discretion, and redirect inappropriate discussion. Speak privately with a student if needed.</li>
      <li>All addictions—whether media, substance, or behavior—are based on the lie that something other than God will satisfy. While the form differs, the root is the same: <b>sinful nature</b>. Jesus is our way to freedom.</li>
      <li>This lesson may lead to quiet reflection more than open discussion. Be sensitive to what teens are willing to share.</li>

    <h3>INSTRUCTION</h3>
    
    <h4>WELCOME <span style="float:right;">🕒 5 MINUTES</span></h4>
    <p><i>Welcome the teens back to class. Ask them to share what God taught them through Psalm 40. Thank them for sharing.</i></p>
    
    <h3>REVIEW <span style="float:right;">🕒 5 MINUTES</span></h3>
    
    <p><b>Say:</b> Last week, we read about how Adam and Eve chose to rebel against God.</p>
    
    <h4>Ask:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>What were the consequences of Adam and Eve’s choice to take the knowledge of good and evil?  
        <blockquote><i>Answers should include: Their relationships with God and others were broken. Sin spread like a disease to everyone. Death entered the world.</i></blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>What happens when everyone “does what is right in their own eyes”?  
        <i>(Answers will vary.)</i>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><b>Say:</b> Sin entered the world. We still feel the effects of that choice today. But sin is more than one choice two people made a long time ago.</p>
    <p>Each of us is guilty of rebelling against God. Our sinful nature leads us to do things we know are bad for ourselves and others, but we cannot make ourselves stop! 
    Even though we know our addictions to social media, substances, or behaviors are wrong, we cannot quit them. 
    <mark>It can feel like a battle inside that we are not strong enough to fight on our own.</mark></p>
    
    <p><b>But here’s the good news:</b> We don’t have to fight alone. God knows our weaknesses, and He will help us do what we cannot do by ourselves. 
    God gives us a new nature, and by His power, we can be free!</p>

    <h3>GAME <span style="float:right;">🕒 10 MINUTES</span></h3>
    
    <h4>Two Truths and a Lie</h4>
    <blockquote>
    Create groups of 2–3. Each teen will share two truths and one lie about themselves. The others guess the lie.
    </blockquote>
    
    <p><b>Say:</b> Raise your hand if you were able to trick your classmates. This game helps us get to know each other better, but also teaches an important lesson: 
    <mark>It is easy to pretend to be someone you are not.</mark> This is especially true on social media.</p>

    <h3>TEACHING <span style="float:right;">🕒 30 MINUTES</span></h3>
    
    <h4>Introduction:</h4>
    <p><i>Write the focus questions on the board: Why are we so influenced by other people’s approval? Why do we do things we know are bad for us and others?</i></p>
    
    <p><b>Say:</b> Today you tried to see if your friends were telling the truth or a lie. 
    We do this in games—but many of us believe lies in real life. 
    Maybe you lie on social media to fit in. Or maybe you believe the lie that doing something wrong won’t have a consequence.</p>
    
    <h4>Ask:</h4>
    <p>Why is it that even when we know the right thing to do, we still feel the impulse to do wrong?  
    <i>(Answers will vary.)</i></p>
    
    <p><b>Say:</b> Sin is the reason we do things that are bad for us. Sin twists our desires and leads us toward destructive behavior. 
    This generation faces a challenge older generations didn’t have: the internet. It can be used for good, but also leads to sin in new ways.</p>
    
    <h4>Activity:</h4>
    <blockquote>
    Draw a vertical line on the board. Write “The Positive and Negative Things about Social Media.”  
    In one column, write “Positive.” In the other, write “Negative.”
    </blockquote>
    
    <h4>Say:</h4>
    <p>Raise your hand and share something good that social media brings into your life—or a negative way it can influence you.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b>Positive:</b> <i>connects us to distant family, teaches new topics, recipes, fashion, music</i></li>
      <li><b>Negative:</b> <i>bullying, comparison, wasted time, loneliness, addiction</i></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><b>Say:</b> You’re about to read a text conversation between two friends about a sensitive topic. They express regret, but also hope. 
    Read pages 8–9 of <i>“The Biggest Mistake of My Life”</i> silently. After reading, reflect on what connected with you.</p>
    
    <h4>Read:</h4>
    <p><i>Have teens read pages 8–9 silently.</i></p>
    
    <h4>Say:</h4>
    <p>We all want to feel happy, loved, and satisfied. But looking to things instead of our Creator never works. That’s addiction: 
    <mark>using something over and over, hoping it’ll make you feel better. But only God gives satisfaction that lasts.</mark></p>
    
    <h4>Ask:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Ada said she “<i>tried but could not stop</i>” her behaviors. What happens when someone is addicted? Why do addictions happen? <i>(Answers will vary.)</i></li>
      <li>Zora found words in the Bible that described her internal battle. What is she talking about? Can you relate? <i>(Answers will vary.)</i></li>
      <li>How does Zora describe the change she experienced?  
        <blockquote><i>Answers should include: Zora describes God transforming her when she believed in Jesus; an old part of her died, and something new came alive in her; Jesus now lives in her, and she trusts in Him.</i></blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>How can we fight the battle with sin within us?  
        <blockquote><b>Answer:</b> By having a relationship with God and trusting in Jesus.</blockquote>
