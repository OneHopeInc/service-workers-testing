    <h3>INSTRUCTION</h3>

    <h4>WELCOME <span style="float:right;">üïí 20 MINUTES</span></h4>
    <p><b>Say:</b> Welcome! Over the next few weeks, we will be exploring some of life‚Äôs hardest questions. As I pass out your books, look through them. Flip through the pages and preview the topics. Once you have looked through the book, go back to the table of contents. Put a mark next to the articles you are most excited to read. In your book, write about why you chose them. Add questions you have about these topics and do not be afraid to write down hard questions! You do not have to share your questions with the class.</p>
    <h3>TEACHING</h3>
    <h4><b>Introduction:</b> <i>Write the focus question on the board: Who are you?</i></h4>

    <h4>Ask:</h4>
    <p>How do you define yourself? Raise your hand and share the words you might use to talk about who you are. 
    <i>(Allow teens to respond. If they need help, start with words like, ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù or ‚Äúschoolmate.‚Äù Write their answers around the focus question.)</i></p>

    <h4>Say:</h4>
    <p>Many of you used words describing the relationships you have with others, like: ‚Äúson‚Äù, ‚Äúsister‚Äù or ‚Äúfriend‚Äù or that you are a part of a tribe. You also added the things you do, like: ‚Äúmusician‚Äù or ‚Äúsoccer player.‚Äù And while all of these titles, interests and tribal names do shape you, the core of who you are is deeper. To find out who you truly are and how you should live, you need to look to the One who designed you: your Creator, God.</p>

    <p><b>Say:</b> Now, open your books to <i>‚ÄúThe Best Version of Yourself‚Äù</i> on page 1. Follow along as I read and underline anything that stands out to you.</p>

    <h4>Read:</h4>
    <p><i>‚ÄúThe Best Version of Yourself‚Äù</i> on page 1 of the teen book out loud.</p>

    <h4>Ask:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>What stood out to you as we read page 1? <i>(Allow teens to respond.)</i></li>
    <li>When you have big questions about life, where have you looked for answers? Why would it make sense to look to God for the answers?  
        <blockquote><i>Answers should include: because God made me, He knows everything about me, He has a purpose for my life, the world‚Äôs wisdom is foolish, etc.</i></blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>What does it mean to live wisely?  
        <blockquote><i>Answers should include: to live according to God's design, in a personal relationship with Him.</i></blockquote>
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Say:</h4>
    <p>The world has drifted a long way from God's wisdom, but there is good news: God promises that if you look for Him, you will find Him. Matthew 7:7 says, 
    <q>Keep on asking, and you will receive what you ask for. Keep on seeking, and you will find. Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened to you.</q></p>

    <p><b>Say:</b> Now, turn to the article, <i>‚ÄúKnowing Your Creator‚Äù</i>, on page 2 in your books where we will learn more about who God is. 
    As you take turns reading out loud to the class, follow along and <mark>circle words that show God‚Äôs love for you</mark>. 
    Stop when you get to the Selfie Challenge.</p>

    <h4>Read:</h4>
    <p><i>Have teens take turns reading page 2, ‚ÄúKnowing Your Creator,‚Äù out loud. Do not have them read the ‚ÄúSelfie Challenge‚Äù section yet; it will be read at the end of the lesson.</i></p>

    <h4>Ask:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>What words did you underline that show God‚Äôs love for you? <i>(Allow teens to respond.)</i></li>
    <li>What does this article tell you about how much God values you? 
        <blockquote><i>God created amazing things like the moon and stars, but it is people that He crowns with glory and honour; 
        He cares for you and He knit you together in your mother‚Äôs womb; He thinks of you constantly; He never leaves you alone.</i></blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>What do you think it means that human beings are the masterpiece of God‚Äôs creation? <i>(Answers will vary.)</i></li>
    <li>After you read this page, how does it change how you see God and how He sees you? <i>(Answers will vary.)</i></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Say:</h4>
    <p>You had some really good answers to those questions. Let us discover what else we will learn as we continue on page 3; 
    follow along as you take turns reading out loud to the class. Be sure to watch for who God is and what He does.</p>

    <h4>Read:</h4>
    <p><i>Have teens continue taking turns reading page 3 of ‚ÄúKnowing Your Creator‚Äù out loud.</i></p>

    <h3>CLOSING AND REFLECTION <span style="float:right;">üïí 10 MINUTES</span></h3>

    <h4>Ask:</h4>
    <p>Do you ever feel like you do not matter or like you have to earn love? Look back to the words you underlined on page 2. 
    God‚Äôs Word is clear. God made you on purpose. You are His work of art. He thinks about you constantly. 
    He is always with you because He loves you.</p>

    <h4>(Optional Activity)</h4>
    <p>In the space provided, write a short prayer to God thanking Him for creating you with such care and being present with you always.</p>

    <h4>Prayer:</h4>
    <pre><code>
    God, thank you for your good design. You are the awesome Creator. Thank you for creating us with a purpose 
    and giving us an identity as your masterpiece. Forgive us for forgetting you and looking for satisfaction 
    in other places. Help us to seek you and grow to know you more as we read your Word, the Bible. 
    Help us to show your love to others. Amen.
    </code></pre>

    <h4>Call to Action / Weekly Challenge</h4>
    <p><b>Say:</b> Look at the ‚ÄúSelfie Challenge‚Äù on page 2 of your book. This week, post a selfie with creation, thanking God in the caption for His great work of art. 
    Share the image on social media and use this hashtag: <code>#ABetterWaytoLifeAfrica</code></p>

    <p><i>If you do not have a cell phone or social media, give a meaningful comment to someone close to you.</i></p>
